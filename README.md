## Overview

### Peers 

The system is designed to be decentralized. This means that there is no central server. Instead, the system is made up of multiple peers. Each peer is responsible for a specific service. This allows for easy scaling and redundancy.


### Uniform API Interface

The system is designed to have a uniform interface. This means that all services will have a consistent API. This allows for easy integration and scaling.
